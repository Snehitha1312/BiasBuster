# BiasBuster
# Game Overview

This game immerses players in the exciting journey of developing an ethical AI system for a self-driving car. Each level focuses on a critical phase of AI development, emphasizing compliance with the **EU AI Act** and educating players on ethical and technical best practices. Players progress by overcoming challenges related to **data collection**, **cleaning**, **security**, and **bias testing**, ensuring their AI system is transparent, fair, and robust.

## Core Objective

The primary goal of the game is to design and develop a self-driving car AI system that adheres to ethical guidelines and regulatory standards. Players must make strategic decisions to collect, clean, secure, and test data while balancing risks and rewards. Each level highlights a specific step in AI development, reinforcing key concepts like **data integrity**, **fairness**, **robustness**, and **privacy**.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Players engage in hands-on activities like coin collection, data cleaning, avoiding adversarial attacks, and bias testing.
- **Ethical AI Education**: The game educates players on critical aspects of the EU AI Act, such as transparency, fairness, privacy, and robustness.
- **Challenging Gameplay**: Creative mechanics simulate real-world AI challenges, including data inconsistency, adversarial attacks, and bias detection.
- **Feedback and Awareness**: Each level ends with a detailed summary panel that explains the importance of the tasks performed and how they align with ethical AI development principles.
-  At the end of Chapter 4, if the car does not hit anyone it means there is no bias while collecting data, and the player is successful. Players should strive to improve their points 
  accordingly

## Chapters Overview

### Chapter 1: Data Collection

- **Setting**: Tech City, a bustling hub of technological innovation.
- **Objective**: Drive a self-driving car to collect data coins scattered along the road.
- **Types of Coins**:
  - **Green Coins (Consented Data)**: Ethically sourced data with proper consent. These coins ensure compliance with the EU AI Act principles like transparency, fairness, and privacy.
  - **Red Coins (Unconsented Data)**: Private, unconsented data. Collecting these coins might offer higher immediate rewards but carries significant risks, such as legal penalties and reputational damage.
- At the end of this level a panel is shown with a summary of the coins collected and the consequences of collecting private data.

### Chapter 2: Data Cleaning

- **Objective**: Act as a "Data Detective" to clean and organize traffic signals.
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - **Blue Box**: Drag and drop traffic signals where the text matches the symbol (correct data).
  - **Red Box**: Drag and drop traffic signals where the text does not match the symbol (incorrect or inconsistent data).
- **Purpose**:
  - Highlight the importance of data cleaning to ensure AI model accuracy and performance.
  - Educate players on how errors in data can lead to poor outcomes in AI models.
- **End of Chapter**: Successfully cleaning all the traffic signals takes the player to the next level.

### Chapter 3: Avoiding Adversarial Attacks

- **Objective**: Navigate the car safely to the garage while avoiding danger signs within a 1-minute time limit.
- **Key Mechanics**:
  - Danger signs represent different types of **adversarial attacks**:
    - Black-box attacks
    - Poisoning attacks
    - Evasion attacks
    - Textual adversarial attacks
  - Colliding with a danger sign reduces car health by 1 (initial health = 3). If health reaches 0 or time runs out, the chapter ends with a "Game Over" screen.
- **End of Level**:
  - A summary panel educates players on the adversarial attacks encountered and provides concise explanations of each attack.
  - Emphasizes the importance of building AI models resilient to attacks, aligning with the **EU AI Act's** robustness and security requirements.

### Chapter 4: Testing AI Fairness and Bias

- **Objective**: Test the AI modelâ€™s fairness and bias through three test cases:
  1. **White Man**
  2. **Black Man**
  3. **Handicapped Person**
- **Test Procedure**:
  - **Detection and Recognition**: Assess the AI system's ability to detect pedestrians, traffic signals, and obstacles in the environment for all cases.
  - **Decision-making**: Evaluate if the AI system responds consistently and fairly across all cases, without bias.
- **Purpose**: Highlight the importance of unbiased AI models that treat all individuals fairly, aligning with ethical AI principles and the **EU AI Act**.
